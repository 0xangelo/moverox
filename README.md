Easily convert datatypes (structs/enums) from your Move packages into "oxidized", [BCS]-compatible versions and seamlessly keep them up-to-date as you update your Move code.

[BCS]: https://docs.rs/bcs/latest/bcs/

## Features

Let's take, for example, the dynamic field struct defined in the [Sui] framework package:
```move
// module sui::dynamic_field; 

/// Internal object used for storing the field and value
public struct Field<Name: copy + drop + store, Value: store> has key {
    /// Determined by the hash of the object ID, the field name value and it's type,
    /// i.e. hash(parent.id || name || Name)
    id: UID,
    /// The value for the name of this field
    name: Name,
    /// The value bound to this field
    value: Value,
}
```

### Synchronizing Rust with Move

We can oxidize this struct (and all datatypes in the [Sui] Move package) by using [`moverox-build`]. As the name suggests, that is done in the `build.rs` script for your crate. See [`moverox-sui/build.rs`] for an example of how it's done in practice. The advantage of using a build script is that it will re-run every time the linked Move sources change, **keeping your oxidized Move datatypes in sync with your Move code**.

### BCS-compatible oxidized datatypes

The `Field` struct above will be translated into the Rust equivalent:
```rust
// Simplified from `moverox-build`'s output
pub mod dynamic_field {
    /// Internal object used for storing the field and value
    #[derive(
        Clone,
        Debug,
        PartialEq,
        Eq,
        Hash,
        serde::Deserialize,
        serde::Serialize,
        ::moverox::traits::MoveDatatype,
    )]
    #[move_(address = "0x2")]
    #[move_(module = dynamic_field)]
    pub struct Field<Name, Value> {
        /// Determined by the hash of the object ID, the field name value and it's type,
        /// i.e. hash(parent.id || name || Name)
        pub id: super::object::UID,
        /// The value for the name of this field
        pub name: Name,
        /// The value bound to this field
        pub value: Value,
    }
    impl<Name, Value> Field<Name, Value> {
        pub const fn new(id: super::object::UID, name: Name, value: Value) -> Self {
            Self { id, name, value }
        }
    }
    impl<Name, Value> ::moverox::traits::HasKey for Field<Name, Value> {
        fn address(&self) -> ::moverox::types::Address {
            self.id.id.bytes
        }
    }
}
```
Notice:
- the type is declared under `mod dynamic_field`, matching the Move module it comes from
- `serde` traits, since it's BCS-compatible with how the Move type is serialized
- `id: super::object::UID` because `moverox-build` recognizes `UID` is an implicit import, resolves to its full path and sees that the type is defined in the same package (a `mod object` was also generated and contains the oxidized `UID`)
- `HasKey` trait implementation because the Move type has the `key` ability
- `MoveDatatype` derivation, more on this below

### Smart type tags

Notice `Field` is annotated with `#[derive(MoveDatatype)]`, `#[move_(address = "0x2")]`, and `#[move_(module = dynamic_field)]`. All of that pertains to the last layer of code generation, which is this case produces:
```rust
pub struct FieldTypeTag<Name: MoveTypeTag, Value: MoveTypeTag> {
    pub type_name: Name,
    pub type_value: Value,
}
```
The type above is a specialization of the generic Move [`StructTag`]. Notice that, unlike the latter, `FieldTypeTag`:
- doesn't have an `address` field because of the `#[move_(address = "0x2")]` attribute, therefore it implements [`ConstAddress`] with that value, i.e., we know `Field` is defined in a package published at `0x2`
- doesn't have a `module` field because of the `#[move_(module = dynamic_field)]` attribute, therefore it implements [`ConstModule`] with that value, i.e., we know `Field` is defined in a module named `dynamic_field`
- doesn't have a `name` field because `Field` is obviously the name we expect, therefore it implements [`ConstName`] with that value
- has `type_name` and `type_value` instead of `type_params`, because `Field` can only have 2 type parameters

All of the above is leveraged when parsing a string into a `FieldTypeTag` (or converting a `StructTag` into it). For example, for a `Field<Vec<u8>, u64>` type, the corresponding `FieldTypetag` (`<Field<Vec<u8>, u64> as MoveDatatype>::StructTag`) expects a specific string representation:
```rust
"0xabc::dynamic_field::Field<vector<u8>, u64>" // Converting from StructTag: Wrong address: expected 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002, got 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000abc
"0x2::field::Field<vector<u8>, u64>" // Converting from StructTag: Wrong module: expected dynamic_field, got field
"0x2::dynamic_field::DynamicField<vector<u8>, u64>" // Converting from StructTag: Wrong name: expected Field, got DynamicField
"0x2::dynamic_field::Field<vector<u8>, u64, u64>" // Converting from StructTag: Wrong type parameters: Wrong number of generics: expected 2, got 3
"0x2::dynamic_field::Field<vector<u8>, u64>" // Passes
```

### Safe deserialization

Finally, combining the above is the `parse_move_instance`

## Inspirations

This project was mostly inspired by [`tonic-build`] in how it generates Rust code from Protobuf files and the declarative macro [`tonic`]  for including generated files in crates.

It incorporates a lot of lessons learned from my previous work developing [`af-sui-pkg-sdk`], which had similar goals but exported a declarative macro with lots of limitations and required manual work to keep the generated types updated as the Move code evolved.
